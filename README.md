## Lizzie Hard

After 4 years working in an Investment Bank I am looking for a new challenge and to enhance my programming skills. I am enthusiastic and a quick learner and in previous a roles I have enjoyed collaborating with various teams solve problems and working towards better user functionalities.

## Skills

#### Communication

During my time working in Operations at an investment bank I have developed my communications skills in multiple settings. As part of a global team I have shown my ability to collaborate with regional colleagues, navigating the difficulties of physical distance and alternative business methods through transparency and knowledge sharing.
I often have to communicate complicated issues quickly and precisely adjusting my style depending on the audience. I am confident communicator and I look to continually enhanced my skills by taking opportunities such as sitting on panels at recruitment events and presentations to senior stakeholders.


#### Works Well Under Pressure

I am used to working in high-pressure environments and have demonstrated my ability to work to strict deadlines such as funding deadlines in previous roles.  I would often have competing demands and I am confident in being able to prioritize my work to ensure the most high risk tasks are completed first. During my time I was also happy to take on demanding and challenging projects such as ensuring our systems were ready in time for new regulatory demands.

In my spare time I like to play hockey with Wapping Hockey Club, whether its league hockey in winter or summer hockey to keep up the fitness levels. I enjoy reading and I’m currently working my way through a lot of classics. When I have time I love to cook from one of my many recipe books or check out a new restaurant I’ve read about. I also love exploring new places either in London or completely new countries.
