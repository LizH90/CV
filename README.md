## Skills

#### Communication

While working in my previous role I was able to develop my communications skills in multiple settings. As part of a global team I have shown my ability to collaborate with regional colleagues. This involved navigating the difficulties of physical distance and alternative business methods to complete tasks in tight timeframes.
I often had to communicate complicated issues quickly and precisely adjusting my style depending on the audience. I am confident communicator and looked for opportunities to continually enhance my skills. These included sitting on panels at recruitment events and presenting to senior stakeholders.

#### Works Well Under Pressure

I am used to working in high-pressure environments and have often demonstrated my ability to work to strict deadlines. I had many targets to manage on a daily basis such as funding cut off times; if these were not met they would incur a financial penalty to the business.
I would often have competing demands and I am confident in being able to prioritise my work to ensure the highest risk tasks are completed first. During my time I was also happy to take on challenging projects such as ensuring our systems were ready in time for new regulatory demands.
